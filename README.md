# Security and Compliance: 
Implemented stringent security measures and compliance standards (e.g., GDPR) within the onboarding system, ensuring data privacy and regulatory requirements are met.

# Testing and Deployment: 
Conducted rigorous testing phases (unit, integration, and user acceptance testing) and coordinated deployment activities, ensuring a smooth rollout of the onboarding system across multiple locations.

# Technologies Used: 
ABAP, ABAP RAP, SAP Fiori/UI5, RESTful APIs, SAP ERP, SAP SuccessFactors, GDPR compliance.
